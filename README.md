README

Included are a server and a client for 2-way TCP/IP chat.

"make"or "make all"will create binaries for both.  "make clean" will remove the
binaries.

Set up the server first, it listens on port 8888.

Connect the client by passing the argument as follows:
./client <$HOSTNAME> 8888

If interfacing with other servers then specify requisit port numbers to
interface with them.

Discussion:

This was extremely challenging.  While I quickly understood programming
sockets, I had trouble with some of the nuances in C.  I did not get to program
in C++ and I fear I did myself a disservice.  I was not able to master using
optional arguments from flags for the command line.  

I also found it difficult to print a valuable local ip for the server side.  I
can print the ip, but it is going to always be "localhost" or "0.0.0.0" and I
was unable to figure out the nuances of getting the extrenal ip of the machine
through C.  This is something I would like to know more about dearly.
